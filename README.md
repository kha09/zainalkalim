Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local environment:

1. **Install Node.js**  
   Download and install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if it’s not already installed on your system. Node.js includes `npm`, which is used for managing dependencies.

   If you haven’t done so already, download or clone the project to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>

3. **Install Dependencies**
   
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install

4. **Run the Development Server**  
   Start the development server with one of the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun dev

5. **View the Project**  
   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application. The server will automatically reload if you make edits to the code.
